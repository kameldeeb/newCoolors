# React Color Palette Generator

This is a React-based application that allows users to generate color palettes, lock colors, like/dislike colors, and perform other actions like copying color codes and downloading files. The app uses `react-router-dom`, `react-toastify`, `@tanstack/react-query`, and other libraries to enhance functionality and provide an interactive user experience.

## Features
- **Color Palette Generation**: Randomly generate color palettes.
- **Lock and Unlock Colors**: Lock a color to prevent changes and unlock it when needed.
- **Like and Dislike Colors**: Toggle favorite colors by liking or disliking.
- **Copy Color Codes**: Easily copy color codes to the clipboard.
- **Download Options**: Download color data in CSS or PDF formats.
- **Dynamic State Handling**: Real-time updates of color states via API integration.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router**: For routing and navigation between different pages.
- **React Query**: For fetching, caching, and synchronizing server state.
- **Ant Design**: UI component library for styled components like Splitter, Dropdowns, etc.
- **React Icons**: For using customizable icons.
- **React Toastify**: For displaying notifications such as success and error messages.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout management.
